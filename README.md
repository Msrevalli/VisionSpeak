## **VisionSpeak: AI-Powered Image Description for the Visually Impaired**

### **Overview**
**VisionSpeak** is a Streamlit-based AI application designed to assist visually impaired users by providing detailed descriptions of images using OpenAI's **GPT-4 Vision** and generating audio feedback using OpenAI‚Äôs **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** model. The app allows users to capture images, receive a detailed textual description, and listen to the description in multiple languages with different AI-generated voices.

### **Key Features**
1. **Image Captioning with GPT-4 Vision**  
   - Users can capture an image using their webcam, and the app will generate a detailed description of the image using OpenAI's **GPT-4o**.
  
2. **Multi-Language Translation Support**  
   - The image description can be translated into multiple languages, including:
     - **English** (en)
     - **Telugu** (te)
     - **Tamil** (ta)
     - **Kannada** (kn)
     - **Hindi** (hi)  
   - Translation is handled using **GoogleTranslator**.

3. **AI-Generated Audio Feedback**  
   - Users can listen to the translated description in a natural AI-generated voice.
   - Multiple AI voices are available, including **alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, and shimmer**.
   - The audio file is generated and stored locally for playback.

4. **Secure API Key Handling**  
   - Users must enter their OpenAI API key to enable AI-powered functionalities.
   - The app ensures that API keys are managed securely.

5. **Efficient Image Processing**  
   - Captured images are processed and converted into **Base64** format for OpenAI API requests.
   - The app ensures optimal image quality for processing.

6. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - **Minimalist UI** with clear instructions.
   - Simple controls for language and voice selection.
   - Automatic handling of missing API keys and errors.
